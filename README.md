## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Challenge 1: Implementing a complex feature like the login system with multi-factor authentication.

Solution: I researched Firebase authentication and integrated it with custom phone verification and email/password sign-in. I also implemented token management to keep users securely logged in."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I researched Firebase authentication and successfully integrated it into the app."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Challenge 2: Debugging issues related to Gradle builds causing build failures on certain environments.]
   - **Solution**: [Solution: I analyzed the Gradle logs, identified version conflicts between dependencies, and updated the build scripts to enforce compatible versions, resolving the conflicts and stabilizing the build process.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Reminder and Notification System: Enable users to set up personalized reminders or push notifications to stay on track with their tasks or goals.

]
2. **Feature 2**: Cloud Database Integration: Integrate with a cloud-based database to securely store user data, allowing access from multiple devices and ensuring data persistence.]
3. **Feature 3**: [Dark Mode: Introduce a dark mode theme to reduce eye strain and provide a more comfortable user experience during nighttime or low-light usage.]
